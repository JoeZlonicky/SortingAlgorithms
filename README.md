# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
Visualizes the process of sorting algorithms by display randomized data being sorted by them.  
**NOTE:** Does not complete sorting in a realistic amount of time due to number of times the data is drawn to the screen. Some algorithms may appear signficantly faster or slower than they actually are based off the number of updates they make to the screen.
